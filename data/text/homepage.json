        "<p>Imagine that you have just completed a public consultation event. You published an online survey and received over 1000 responses from Canadian citizens. You are now faced with a large and complex spreadsheet of survey responses and need to create a report and present actionable recommendations. How do you get there? How do you demonstrate to citizens that you effectively managed and analyzed their responses?</p><p>The responses and feedback that you collect from citizens during public consultations is valuable data that needs to be effectively managed so that it can inform decision-making. While there are many important activities that go into planning and executing a public consultation event (whether it be online or in person), the work does not stop once the event is complete. You may end up with large volumes of citizen feedback (data) in a variety of structured and unstructured formats. By possessing a strong foundation in data literacy, you will be better able to translate this complex data into actionable knowledge, leading to more informed decision-making.</p><p>This data literacy guide is intended to promote data literacy for Government of Canada employees who are involved in planning, implementing, and evaluating public engagement processes.</p>"
